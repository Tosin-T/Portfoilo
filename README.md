# Portfolio

This is a portfolio I created  using HTML and CSS. The purpose of the project as the name implies is to create an interactive hub to showcase and display the projects I have worked on. I found this to be a challenge but overall I am proud of the outcome. If you have constructive feedback please drop me a message!
